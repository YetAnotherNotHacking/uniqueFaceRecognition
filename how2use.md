# How in the McChicken does this work?

1. Collect images
    - "dataset" folder must be empty, or you atleast need to not use a name that is already used in a folder for a person's dataset. any number of images suppored, I recommend you get a variety of angles and light temperature/brightness for the best effect.
    - "output" folder must be empty

2. Extract embedings

3. Train

4. Preview with face_recognizer
